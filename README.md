To install this project, simply download the zip file or clone the SSH key to your terminal. GitHub has instructions on how to do this. Also will need to install NODE in order to run build functions within your terminal.

## How it works?

- When viewing the deployed application, you will be presented with the users profile picture and name, along with a slogan.
